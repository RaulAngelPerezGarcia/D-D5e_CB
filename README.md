# DnD5e_CB 
# Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition character builder

This is a side project for myself in which I construct a character builder for the role playing game Dungeons and Dragons. 
The main goal for this project is to teach myself how to program in html, css, bootstrap and javascript.


```
git clone https://github.com/RaulAngelPerezGarcia/DnD5e_CB.git
```

### Installing

First you must install the dependencies.
This should do it:

```
npm install
```

## Running the program

After installing I run it in a local server listening to the port 8080

In order to run it go to the original folder and run it with:

```
npm app.js
```
and go to 'http://localhost:8080/' while it is running
